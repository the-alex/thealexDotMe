The artile can be found <a href="http://waleedkhan.name/281/sublime-clang/">here</a>, but I wanted to take some time to reflect on what made EECS 281 the most socially and academically rewarding class I have taken at the University of Michigan.</p>

                                        <br> its this very flow of rhythms
                                        <br> that keeps the widening schisms
                                        <br> at bay shortly preceding

                                        <br> no place to placate-
                                        <br> Its dangerous in that way,
                                        <br> because another distraction
                                        <br> is a possible reaction
                                        <br> to the fear that I might not be working enough.
                                        <br> Procrastination is a common thread-
                                        <br> the parallel processes
                                        <br> across the distributed network of the neurons
                                        <br> that make up my conscious mind
                                        <br> find that tossing and turning
                                        <br> equates to learning
                                        <br> amongs the moonlit covers of my bed.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> At night the fire is bright restless and unending
                                        <br> the flames dance until I jump to put them out.
                                        <br> I worry that if I'm not always hurrying towards the end of my life
                                        <br> my life might end.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> It's In this phraseology my psychologiy is revealed,
                                        <br> I'm told the escape is good for me, and it's easy to believe.
                                        <br> I'm told that work is what will bring me joy.
                                        <br> I know love what I do but I think I love people more.
                                        <br> I love the rhymes they speak-
                                        <br> The lows and highs-
                                        <br> its the peaks that stick out to me.
                                        <br> The crecendo in their voices
                                        <br> the melody in their emotions-
                                        <br> I'm drawn to my friends out of raw desire
                                        <br> until the fire is lit under me
                                        <br> and it's all down to the wire
                                        <br> once again
                                        <br> ... until I can break free.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Another all nighter
                                        <br> and while that may seem extreme
                                        <br> so would the habits I've held
                                        <br> that help me blow off steam.
                                        <br> I'm a three beer queer so long as there isn't a fourth nearby.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Work hard play hard, right?
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Always the extremes-
                                        <br> my life seems to play this theme
                                        <br> over and over
                                        <br> as if I fail to see the four leaf clovers surrounding the black cat that distracts-
                                        <br> she struts on by me like she was placed here
                                        <br> to make me fear
                                        <br> that I was going to fail
                                        <br> right then and there-
                                        <br> that if I wasn't in the library while another student was,
                                        <br> all blame is deserved and fair.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> I think I need to a little bit more aware.

                                        <br> I think what I need to accept that there will always be the option for escape-
                                        <br> and that I'll always want for it.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Whether it be in the rhythm of my drums
                                        <br> or the melody of my loved ones-
                                        <br> there will always be a time and place for these extremes.
                                        <br> The doubt that I'm working hard enough
                                        <br> and the worry that I'm not living enough.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> But what would be a life without both?
                                        <br> I tend to forget-
                                        <br> a life without contrast once
                                        <br> and the recent past came to blast
                                        <br> the mast and my sails whole sale
                                        <br>off the USS "easy living"
                                        <br> and I realized that once again ... I'm just not satisfied anymore.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> And while it may seem from my verbose description
                                        <br> that I've headed the warnings of past inscriptions
                                        <br> I still find myself brushing against these ancient spectors.

                                    <p>
                                        I have been very fortunate to have been parented in part by Nicholas Johns. Nick is responsible for many aspects of my personality or life values that I find both constructive and positive to my being. In fewer words, I owe much of who I am today to Nick.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Among many things, he taught me to understand the potential of all human beings and the joy in the pursuit of knowledge. However, I am most maybe most grateful that Nick allowed me a vast amount of freedom. Freedom that allowed me to experiment with interests, hobbies, and fundamentally my own personality. I was allowed the freedom to find out who I wanted to be. Nick saw his role as a guide to facilitate me to be that person.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Consequently I was given the freedom to pursue opportunities rarely presented to anyone my age: I don't know of another father who would allow their fourteen year old son (with little to no financial experience) to invest in volatile "Penny Stocks".
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I'm not sure what motivated him when he started, but Nick began 'day trading' around the beginning of my freshman year of high school. He had made a hobby of hunting down stocks that had a high daily volatility with a very low price per share. His end goal with an investment, as hinted by the name, was to invest and divest in the same day for a relatively sound return on investment (ROI). Since the cost of a trade (buy or sell) on Scottrade was $7, the revenue generated by the sale only needed to be greater than $14 total for a positive ROI.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I remember Nick explaining this to me one afternoon and being fascinated. I asked him what companies he was following and quickly tapped their names into the native notepad app on my phone and later into google. I wanted to know the "story" of each company. Who was their CEO? What else have they done? Who is their primary investor? What's their product? Is it well received? There was a narrative thread that each company had, and some of them overlapped.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Through conversation, Nick eventually offered me a small fund to invest in my own portfolio. I asked if he had any tips for me, and he offered this string in return. "Low cap, bio-pharmaceutical companies". And with that, I had my target portfolio.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Before we go any further, I'd like to draw attention to some of the restrictions I was facing being a student trader in high school in 2010.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            The trading day started at 9:30 am and ended at 4:00 pm, Monday through Friday.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    School began at 7:33am and ended at 2:15, Monday through Friday.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The primary method of trading was on a mobile phone.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    Phones were confiscated on sight.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        There was the occasional teacher who allowed students to have phones out in their class. More prevalent was the teacher who wouldn't notice me tapping away under the desk. However, the threat of having my phone confiscated in the middle of a turbulent trading day was all too real, so I took special precautions to limit the screen's exposure to the classroom. So with a firm understanding of the obstacles ahead, I set out to build my portfolio.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It turns out that the two hottest sectors of bio-pharm are cancer treatment and weight loss, with the latter of the two seeing the most progress (go figure). Companies like EntroMedics Inc., Vivus, and Arena Pharmaceutical all had drugs or treatments in clinical phase trials said to facilitate weight loss with minimal effort. But there were obvious problems with each.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Arena was trying to get it's amphetamine based Lorcaserin approved against the general medical conciseness of "Amphetamines are bad" and eventually pivoted with a new drug called "Belviq". EntroMedics had some weird hardware that proposed to zap the fat away, and Vivus was attempting what Arena was doing with another amphetamine based drug, but apparently succeeding anyway.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There's one key observation to make about these companies. Not only were they in a hot sector of the bio-pharm market, they all had absolutely zero dollars in revenue. The value of these companies was purely speculative, based primarily on the likelihood of FDA approval. This principle gives way to two easily recognizable trends.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The first: the dates of the clinical trials and FDA verdict were publicly available, so speculation would cause the value of the company to rise in anticipation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The second: trading days near the midpoint between clinical trial result dates yield the lowest volatility, and therefore the highest predictability.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These two facts encourage two ways to play the bio-pharm game. Either buy low in anticipation of the speculation that occurs before a clinical trial report or FDA verdict, or buy around the average lower bound for the share price in the last week and sell as soon as the ROI covers the trade cost ($14 in my case).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The latter of the two strategies embodied the "Day Trader" mentality, which I found more entertaining. It forced me to pay attention to the stories of the companies I followed, which was far more engaging than waiting around for speculation on a stock to begin.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After a few months, I had nearly doubled my fund trading once every few days. I might have traded more frequently, but SEC restrictions prevented true day trading in accounts with less than $25k of capital. I felt like the experiment had been a success. Truly anyone of relative intelligence could prosper in this area of the financial game ...
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I invite you to recall the restrictions enumerated above.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There was one class I couldn't manage to trade in. My third period physical science class started around 9:30 am and the market had been rallying around ARNA in anticipation of Lorcaserin's approval. I had broken one of my own rules in buying during this time with the plan to sell directly before the approval. As I recall (possibly falsely), I mistook the date of the verdict for the next day. So during this class the price of ARNA fell by about 58%, tanking the value of my portfolio.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I admitted defeat, at least for the short term. To be an affective day trader required an attention I just couldn't give in my high school years. I have since effectively postponed my self employed day trading career, putting it on the back burner as a plan C if my careers as both a programmer and street drummer fail.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I see myself returning to the stock market someday, though I often wonder if the future of trading will have a place for the day trader. I'll save that thought for another post.
